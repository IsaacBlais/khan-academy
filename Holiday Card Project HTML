        <h1>Happy Holidays</h1>
        
        <h2>Dear Kyle,</h2>
            
        <p>I'm wishing you a merry christmas and happy new year from down here in the Caribbean. I hope school is treating you well. I'm currently sun taning on the beach and having a great time doing activities such as swimming in the majestic waters of the Carribean. Have a good winter, buddy.</p>
        
        <h2>Sincerely, your homie Isaac</h2>
